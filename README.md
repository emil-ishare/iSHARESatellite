# iSHARE Satellite

<img align="right" src="docs/assets/isharelogo-small.png">

The satellite is an application that safeguards trust in a
dataspace. It functions as a register of participants. Participants
can call the satellite API to verify each other. When you verify that
a participant is registered in the satellite, you know that this
participant has signed the agreement, and can be held legally viable;
the participant is indeed a part of the dataspace, also on a "legal
level". Service consumers will often connect with service providers to request data. Service providers should then verify the service consumer's status of 
participance in the dataspace by making an API call to the satellite.
